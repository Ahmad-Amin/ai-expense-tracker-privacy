    <p><b>Receipt Images:</b> Images are saved locally and never uploaded to any server.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      Your data belongs entirely to you. We use your information only to:

        <li>Display your expenses and analytics</li>
        <li>Improve your user experience</li>
        <li>Enable offline storage of your data</li>

    <h2>3. No External Servers</h2>
    <p>
      AI Expense Tracker does <b>not</b> send your personal data, images, or receipts to any outside server.
      All processing (including OCR) is handled through your device or trusted third-party APIs like Google ML Kit or OpenAI
      only when required.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app may use third-party libraries for OCR, AI parsing, or purchases.  
    These services may collect limited technical information required to perform their tasks.</p>

    <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      We may offer Premium or Lifetime features through Google Play Billing.  
      We do not store any payment information—Google Play handles all transactions securely.

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
      All data is stored locally in secure device storage.  
      We take reasonable measures to protect your information and prevent unauthorized access.
    </p>

      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
